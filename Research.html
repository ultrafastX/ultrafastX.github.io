/* Tips for sidebar1:
1. Since we are working in relative units, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar. It will be added to the overall width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
2. Since em units are used for the sidebar value, be aware that its width will vary with different default text sizes.
3. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColHybLtHdr #sidebar1 p" rule.

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. The space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
2. Be aware it is possible to cause float drop (the dropping of the non-floated mainContent area below the sidebar) if an element wider than it can contain is placed within the mainContent div. WIth a hybrid layout (percentage-based overall width with em-based sidebar), it may not be possible to calculate the exact width available. If the user's text size is larger than average, you will have a wider sidebar div and thus, less room in the mainContent div. You should be aware of this limitation - especially if the client is adding content with Contribute.
3. In the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This may help avoid several IE-specific bugs.

    <p class="style31"><strong class="style34">Generation and investigation of ultrafast phenomena  with X-ray free-electron lasers</strong></p>
    <p><span class="style37">X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) deliver intense light pulses  with femtosecond temporal resolution and hundreds of nanometers spatial  resolution, thus making them an ideal tool to probe the molecular-scale  structure of matter on timescales that are characteristic to molecular  motion—or, in other words, to record &quot;movies&quot; of atoms and molecules  moving and reorganizing into different structures. However, since XFEL facilities are a very recent development in the field of X-ray science,  new techniques must be invented to study of a given phenomenon.</span></p>
    <p><span class="style37">Our scientific interests reside at the intersection  of XFELs with hydrodynamics, metastable systems, and phase transitions.  To conduct such experiments, we developed new time-resolved investigation techniques. A major part of our recent work focuses on  hydrodynamic phenomena induced by X-ray lasers in liquids. We are also involved in collaborative studies of rapid ice crystallization in water, of the chemical dynamics during  the photosynthetic cycle in nature, and of the dynamics of biomolecules under  the extreme conditions generated by XFEL irradiation.</span></p>
    <p><span class="style37"><em>A note: what is ultrafast?</em> We use &quot;ultrafast&quot; here in the broad sense of processes  that are currently too &quot;fast&quot; to be investigated experimentally. Thus, &quot;ultrafast&quot; depends on the system being studied, and can range from attoseconds to milliseconds. XFELs can open up new science at all these time scales.</span> </p>
    <p><strong class="style31"><em>Liquid explosions induced by XFELs</em></strong></p>
    <p><span class="style37">X-ray pulses produced at XFEL facilities are so intense that a  single one is sufficient to destroy the sample under investigation. Often, XFEL  experiments must be performed serially on a large number of identical  samples, with a new sample for each X-ray pulse. The most frequently used technique for  enabling such serial experiments is embedding the samples in continuously flowing  liquid jets. The jets are also subject to X-ray damage, which may impede  efforts to run experiments at high repetition rates.</span></p>
    <p class="style37">We used time-resolved, high-resolution optical imaging to  determine the dynamics of the explosions induced by XFEL pulses in liquid  microjets. Our initial goal was to determine the maximum extent, in time and  space, of the damage. We found that the effects of explosions can still be seen  at time delays a billion times longer than the duration of the pulse, and  affect the jets over distances up to a hundred times larger than the diameter  of the X-ray beam. The XFEL explosions are multistep processes in which rapid  high-energy phenomena drive slower dynamics. For example, picosecond isochoric  heating by X-rays drives nanosecond shock waves, which in turn lead to  spectacular microsecond hydrodynamics.</p>
    <p class="style31"><em><strong>Serial crystallography at MHz repetition rate XFELs</strong></em></p>
    <p><span class="style37">A second generation of XFEL facilities is just starting to become operational (EuXFEL in Germany and LCLS-II in California). Their most important feature is that they can deliver hundreds to thousands more pulses per second than previous facilities – thus allowing much faster data collection and making these facilities available to many more researchers than currently possible. However, the very short interval between pulses, down to a fraction of a microsecond, leads to  physical processes that may damage the samples and must be avoided would take full advantage of these new XFELs.</span></p>
    <p><span class="style37">We participated in some of the very first experiments at EuXFEL, which focused on recording protein crystallography data at very high (MHz) pulse rates. We used our expertise in understanding XFEL-induced explosions and shocks to diagnose their negative effects on samples, and develop data collection procedures that avoid these effects.</span>    </p>
    <p><strong class="style31"><em>Generation of deeply-metastable stretched water  with XFELs</em></strong></p>
    <p><span class="style37">If a liquid with free interfaces is at a pressure below its vapor  pressure, it is not thermodynamically stable and will either evaporate or boil.  Nevertheless, it is possible to generate (metastable) liquids at pressures  below the vapor pressure, or even in stretched states (corresponding to a  negative pressure). Liquid water can be subjected to negative pressures for  extended periods of time, but will cavitate if stretched too far. Previous experimental  work dedicated at producing stretched water led to proven techniques for  producing metastable water at pressures down to about −300 atmospheres, but  this pressure is far from the pressure expected for homogenous cavitation  (around -1500 atmospheres), implying that cavitation in pure water occurs  though a heterogeneous cavitation mechanism that is specific to water. </span></p>
    <p><span class="style37">Using the reflection of shock waves produced by XFEL pulses at the  surface of drops of water, we stretched water until it ruptured through  spallation, on a few-nanosecond time scale. We determined from the spallation  dynamics that pressures below -1000 atmospheres were briefly reached in the  liquid—deeper than in all previous experiments that used unconfined water. We  proposed a heterogeneous cavitation model that predicts that in order to break  the apparent &ldquo;negative pressure barrier&rdquo; of -300 atmospheres, water must be  stretched in a few nanoseconds or less. While such stretching rates may appear  impractically rapid for investigations, there are ultrafast optical and X-ray techniques that can easily probe nanosecond processes, and application of these tachniques may be the key to studying water under previously  inaccessible metastable conditions</span>.</p>
    <p><strong class="style31"><em>Metastable and cubic ice</em></strong></p>
    <p><span class="style37">Normal water ice, such as the ice we make in our freezers, is a thermodynamically stable solid with a crystal structure that has a hexagonal molecular symmetry (&quot;hexagonal ice&quot;), which manifests itself in the familiar hexagonal shape of showflakes. But with a slight change in how the molecules are arranged in ice, crystals with cubic crystal symmetry (&quot;cubic ice&quot;) may form. Cubic ice can form when supercooled water freezes at temperatures below 0 °C, but this ice is metastable and will transform into hexagonal ice. Observation of haloes around the sun suggest that crystals of pure cubic ice may form in the atmosphere, and if this is the case, its difference in vapor pressure relative to normal ice would affect how rain and snow form in the clouds. Scientists have attempted to make cubic ice in the lab by freezing supercooled water, but so far the ice produced is not purely cubic - which raises the questions of how cubic one can make the ice, and whether pure cubic ice can actually exist.</span></p>
    <p><span class="style37">A good strategy for observing highy cubic ice is to supercool as much as possible liquid water before freezing, and then probe the ice that forms as soon as possible - to avoid its transformaton to normal hexagonal ice. Our collaborators - Barbara Wyslouzil's group from Ohio State - can produce nanosized water droplets in a supersonic nozzle, and then supercool these nanodrops to below -50 °C before freezing. We have used the X-ray laser at SLAC to determine, less than 100 microseconds after freezing, what type of ice forms during this extreme case of freezing. The analysis of the X-ray diffraction from nanodrops indicates that our ice was 78% cubic, more than other ices produced in the lab, and also more than theoretically predicted limits for how cubic ice can be.</span></p>
    <p><span class="style37">The investigation of cubic ice is important not only for a better understanding of atmospheric processes, but also as an example of rapid nonequilibrum solidification leading to the formation of a metastable solid. When a liquid freezes rapidly, the molecules in the liquid do not have to arrange themselves a perfectly ordered crystal, therefore the formation of metastable or imperfect crystals is not suprising. However, little is known about how an individual molecule, or a group of a few molecules, actually build up the crystal. The combination of rapid freezing with ultrafast diffraction from X-ray lasers offers a promising route to understand or even &quot;see&quot; how rapid nonequilibrium solidification occurs at a molecular scale.</span></p>
    <p><strong class="style34">Microfluidic techniques for studying ice nucleation in supercooled water</strong></p>
    <p><span class="style37">Pure water in micron-sized drops can be supercooled to temperatures  close to -40 ºC, where it spontaneously freezes due to homogeneous nucleation.  Such supercooled drops have been observed in the atmosphere, but reliable production of supercooled water at such temperatures in the lab remains  challenging, and I worked towards better methods for producing, handling, and  investigating supercooled water and the nucleation of ice.</span></p>
    <p><span class="style37">We developed a high-accuracy and high-speed&nbsp;instrument for  studying supercooled water by investigating how statistical ensembles (more  than 10 000 systems) of&nbsp;~100-micron diameter drops of water freeze by  homogenous nucleation of ice. With this instrument, we were able to measure the  rate of homogeneous nucleation of ice with low noise and excellent  reproducibility. This experimental platform is faster and more reliable than  any other previous instruments for the study of ice nucleation, and it also allows  to image at high resolution the freezing dynamics, such as the growth of ice  crystals inside drops of supercooled water.</span></p>
    <p><span class="style37">In another ice nucleation project we investigated whether external  electric fields have an effect on the homogenous nucleation of ice in bulk  water. We applied larger electric fields than in any previous experiments, and  we have not observed any changes in the rates of nucleation.</span></p>
    <p><span class="style37">The most promising application of this experimental platform,  however, is the investigation of heterogeneous nucleation of ice on foreign  particles present in water; the high data throughput of the ice nucleation  instrument allows us to measure quickly the probability of heterogeneous  nucleation over a wide range of temperatures—a feat that is difficult to  achieve using other instruments.</span><span class="style28"><br />
